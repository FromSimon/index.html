        This is my favorite quote from Steve Jobs
    
    <q>
        People think focus means saying yes to the thing you`ve got to focus on. But that`s not what it means at all. 
        It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.
        Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</q>
    
        
            <p>One thing I absolutely love to focus on during my free time is working on my hobbies.

            <h4> Sketching is a skill and hobby that is often satisfying to do, but also difficult when starting out. </h4>
<small> When sketching, I use a pencil that is as light or lighter than 
    <i> 2B </i>. Then I break down the sketch into simple shapes or 3d 
    shapes. Then it comes down to molding shapes into curves and using what 
    knowledge I have of the human body. This is usually my process of 
    sketching and it is fun to see the end result.

    <p> There are several books that I have read such as Harry Potter. One of my favourite quotes from Dumbledore being;</p>
    <q> Harry, did you put your name in the goblet of fire? 
        Dumbledore <mark> asked </mark> <sub> calmly </sub>
